            </ul>
            <p class="p1"><strong>Do you feel more connected to this album because you took the time to physically pick/choose it?</strong></p>
            <p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yeah, I think so. I think since I took the time to choose which album to play, it makes me kind of wonder more, what am I looking for?</span></p>
            <p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong>What did you look for, and what did you avoid when looking through these albums?</strong></span></p>
            <p class="p2"><span class="s1">I kind of avoided stuff that looked very simple I guess? I liked to look at things that had more of an atmospheric feel, or represented a journey. I like to see a story being told. Things like &ldquo;the pitted&rdquo; didn't strike my eyes because it was kind of plain.</span></p>
            <p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong>Did you know anything about the songs played? Were you surprised at how they sounded?</strong></span></p>
            <p class="p2"><span class="s1">I feel like all the songs I listened to besides the last one (Return to the Sea - humans, Id be down to listen to as background music, or if I were just chilling. The first one was kind of standard sounding. Holding the CD kind of gave me sort of a live feel, its more of an experience that I'm not gonna skip through. </span></p>
            <p class="p2"><span class="s1"><em>*30 minutes later, people have wandered in and out, playing their songs through the overhead speakers.*</em></span></p>
            <p class="p2"><span class="s1">Since now I&rsquo;ve been sitting in this room, I feel a lot less inclined to listen to whats been playing, compared to when I picked what to play myself. </span></p>

            <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>What did you look for, and what did you avoid when looking through these albums?</strong></span></p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1">I avoided the more abstract ones, and I was more comfortable with the ones that weren&rsquo;t necessarily new. I judged the covers a lot.</span></p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Did you know anything about the songs played? Were you surprised at how they sounded?</strong></span></p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yes, I knew one of Sting&rsquo;s songs. I was surprised by a few of them, but the other ones were classic sting, like the first song was like oh! I know this.</span></p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Do you think this will affect how you will listen to music in the future?</strong></span></p>

            <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yeah I think because I studied the cover, I tried to correlate what the songs were like based on it. I kind of had, like, a guess or expectation of what it would sound like.</span></p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>What did you look for, and what did you avoid when looking through these albums? </strong></span></p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1">I think I was trying to avoid the darker colored ones. I chose [Escape-ism] because I wouldn&rsquo;t normally listen to it. For the other ones I feel like I knew what they would sound like: kind of mellow, but I wan&rsquo;t sure about this one. I mainly avoided the ones with actual pictures. </span></p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Did you know anything about the songs played? Were you surprised at how they sounded?</strong></span></p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1">It actually was what I was expecting. I think because the album was called escapism, it was probably not part of a regular genre, but was going to try to make its own sound.</span></p>

            <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>What did you look for, and what did you avoid when looking through these albums?</strong></span></p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1">I avoided things that evoked certain genres, like screamo, rap, hiphop. For Barsuk, it was a dog, and it said grrr, and the songs tracks were like bark. And I didn't know what to expect so I picked it.</span></p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Did you know anything about the songs played? Were you surprised at how they sounded?</strong></span></p>

            <p class="p1"><span class="s1">I was pleasantly surprised, and I think I&rsquo;ll actually listen to these songs. I thought [Barsuk Records] would be literally songs of dogs barking, but yeah.</span></p>

            <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Do you feel more connected to these album(s) because you took the time to physically pick/choose it?</strong></span></p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yeah, the circumstances around discovering music for the first time are really interesting. The fact that I picked this album out of the twenty albums that were here, alone adds to the story of this whole search for an album. </span></p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>What did you look for, and what did you avoid when looking through these albums?</strong></span></p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1">I found myself not looking for the realistic artworks, and gravitated towards the more abstract and simple ones.</span></p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Do you feel more connected to this album because you took the time to physically pick/choose it?</strong></span></p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1">No, but it was more or less what I was expecting! </span></p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Do you think this will affect how you will listen to music in the future?</strong></span></p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1">I think I will definitely take more time to listen to music I can pick up. In cd or record stores, I might be more compelled to actually look through CDs or Vinyls, and examine what they might be.</span></p>

            <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Mmm, I was just looking for what was cool and interesting. I think I gravitated to a lot of colors and graphics. The ones that I didn&rsquo;t pick up, they either didn't have a lot of colors, or had a face, or an actual person, or was just kind of bland. </span></p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Do you feel more connected to these album(s) because you took the time to physically pick/choose it?</strong></span></p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Probably, like that weird one we were listening to(Blectum from Blechdom), I would have just skipped if it were online. But it was definitely kind of interesting.</span></p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Did you know anything about the songs played? Were you surprised at how they sounded?</strong></span></p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1">No, I expected [Blectum from Blechdom] to be kind of weird, but not that weird. [Loma] was kind of crazy. The other one was fine.</span></p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Do you think this will affect how you will listen to music in the future?</strong></span></p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yeah, I don't think I would actually go out to a CD store, but if I were to go on Spotify, I would probably look at new music more, and say, &ldquo;Ooh, that&rsquo;s kind of cool! </span></p>

            <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>What did you look for, and what did you avoid when looking through these albums?</strong></span></p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1">I was looking for, kind of just a calming aesthetic? I liked the first one because of the nice sunset/sunrise thingy. I avoided the rock ones, because they just have a vibe where you can say that&rsquo;s probably rock. I also avoided one because it had scribbles and doodles on it, because it would have probably been angsty. I think I like it when there&rsquo;s nature incorporated somewhere in the cover, because I feel like it would be not as constructed, and be more calming, flow-y.</span></p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Do you feel more connected to these album(s) because you took the time to physically pick/choose it?</strong></span></p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1">I don't know, I think if I just found [the album] on spotify randomly or something, I would say,<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>&ldquo;This is good, this is alright,&rdquo; but I probably wouldn&rsquo;t add it to my playlist. But after seeing a cover, it just gives the album a kind of character, a personality. For example the Paul McCartney album, I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have been as inclined to add it on spotify if it just appeared randomly on spotify. But since I saw the cover, I was like oh, I might add this.</span></p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Did you know anything about the songs played? Were you surprised at how they sounded?</strong></span></p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1">The first one. I half expected it to be rock, but I wasn&rsquo;t expecting to not like it. But I think the physical copy makes me kinda respect it, because it shows they put a lot of work into it and stuff. And then the other three, they were pretty up to par on what I was expecting. </span></p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Do you think this will affect how you will listen to music in the future?</strong></span></p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Realistically, probably not. But I think it adds something. I feel like I have more of an appreciation for choosing albums. It takes more work, well not more work, it feels more valuable after picking something to listen to this way.</span></p>

            <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Well these one I liked because of the packaging, the packaging was really like, nice. They&rsquo;re different than other CD&rsquo;s. I liked the little books inside, they were very nice to hold and to look at. I like simplistic things, so I avoided things with lots of color, and with people on it. Most of them I didn&rsquo;t know, besides paul mccartney and guns n roses. I picked miracle of five because it reminds of an album that I liked. </span></p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Do you feel more connected to these album(s) because you took the time to physically pick/choose it?</strong></span></p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1">I mean I would probably avoid these songs if I had just listened to them on spotify. I thought Loma was okay, I don't know if id go back and listen to it, but I still like how it looks. This one (Miracle of Five), I didn't really think I would like it, but I really did.</span></p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Did you know anything about the songs played? Were you surprised at how they sounded?</strong></span></p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Even though the art was not as nice (on Miracle of Five), I really liked it. I was pleasantly surprised. </span></p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Do you think this will affect how you will listen to music in the future?</strong></span></p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Well I don't really listen to CDs and go and buy stuff. I don't think I base of the song off of its art, whether I like it or not. I listen to those weekly songs on spotify and heart what I listen to, and then listen to what else spotify gives me relating to it.</span></p>

        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>From a scale from 1 - 10, how important is music in your life?</em></span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>7, I listen to music very often, almost like a couple hours a day, I feel like I have a lot of playlists with a lot of different moods, so it influences my mood, and also related to what I am doing at the time. And, I'm studying a lot so I listen to it then too.</strong></span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Would you say that you are a &ldquo;music&rdquo; head? (i.e. Metal-head, hip-hop-head, etc.) If so, what is your favorite genre of music?</em></span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>I'm shaking my head, so no! </strong></span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Then do you have a favorite genre of music, or style, or mood</em></span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>I like alternative pop, rnb, basically I like fusion, some old such christian, no more EDM.</strong></span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>How has your taste in music changed over the past 10 years?</em></span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>It&rsquo;s gotten more mellow, I think when I first started listening to music, it was very mainstream, it was what everyone else was listening to. And then I started being all &lsquo;soundcloud&rsquo;, like looking for new things and remixes and underground artist, so I went through that phase. And then, went through an EDM and electronic music. And then I think I transition into alternative electronic, and then alternative rnb, and then more indie kinda stuff, and then classic music/jazz. So it&rsquo;s gotten more mellow, and I think that reflects my sentient on life too.</strong></span></p>life too.</strong></span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Why do you think that is-that you started off listening to what just everyone else listened to, mainstream music?</em></span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>I think it&rsquo;s just whats accessible, because that s like the radio, that's what everyone is listening to. So your first exposure is to what is accessible, and you grab onto that, until you start to look for your own music yourself. Because when you find like underground music or music that is not as well known you have to go through the process of actually listening and finding whether or not you like that.</strong></span></p>
        <p class="p2"><em>When listening to new music, what aspect of the music do you most pay attention to (i.e. the beat/vibe, unexpectedness, wordplay, vocal talent)?</em></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>I usually first listen to the beginning, middle, and end, and then find if its worth dumping into a playlist, where I later listen to fully, and then that's when I start to weed out. I think I listen for intonation, the mood it evokes for me, how I connect to what I'm listening to, what else&hellip; flow, singers voice. Honestly, if theres a nice melody and the lyrics don't make any sense to me, I&rsquo;ll take it out.</strong></span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>How often are you listening to music/have headphones in on an average day?</em></span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Uh a decent amount, I usually listen to it when I wake up, I like morning music and it keeps me awake. Usually when I&rsquo;m walking, I sing sometimes too. And I always listen to music when I'm studying. When I'm reading the bible I'm listening to music too. Yeah, it just depends. I don&rsquo;t consider it listening if the music is just playing in the background.</strong></span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Oh so you don&rsquo;t consider that music?</em></span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>I don't know, is it?</strong></span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>I don't know what do you think? Whats your reasoning for one way or the other?</em></span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>I think it&rsquo;s still considering <em>listening</em>, but theres a difference between active listening and passive listening.</strong></span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Mmm. How often do you practice active listening?</em></span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Not that often to be honest&hellip; just because life is just like that. I feel like when I'm exploring music I'm passively listening. I think active listening is when I'm listening to music and that's it.</strong></span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Say you're studying, do you play a playlist that is new and says will provide this kind of mood, or do you play something that you&rsquo;ve already made that you know will provide the specific mood that you need?</em></span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Most of the time its from things I already know, if I listen to something new, I end up distracted because Ill just start listening to it. My ears just start to transition to that, yeah. </strong></span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Is it easy for you to get lost in the pool of seemingly infinite artists on Spotify and Apple Music when digging around for new music? </em></span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>A lot of my distraction is just clicking on more artists&hellip; yeah, that's a lot of my distractions. I just have too many playlists, I have playlists for like every single sub section of style, all because I enjoy it.</strong></span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>If not an iPod, what was your first exposure to digital music, or the first time you listened to personalized music?</em></span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Well I'm 20 so I was 10&hellip; that's elementary school so 4th grade, 5th grade? Huh. I had a cd player, and I played a lot of classical music when I slept, so I associate that a lot with my sleep. Now classical music I use to lure in the background of my sleep. Had a cd player. Then got my first iPod. How I put stuff on there? The youtube song converter haha, or DVD converters from the library because I didn't want to pay for anything. Before I had an iPod, I just played youtube videos and recorded it on my phone&hellip; that's like really young me.</strong></span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Do you remember buying or receiving a new CD/cassette of an artist/band you liked when you were younger? If so, how did you react?</em></span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>I&rsquo;ve never had a favorite</strong></span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>have you ever been given a cd?</em></span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>I&rsquo;m not really into the owning of CD&rsquo;s</strong></span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>then how would you use your CD player? what would you use?</em></span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Just whatever is at home I guess. I'm just not really into buying physical stuff.</strong></span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Do you think the &ldquo;mood&rdquo; playlists on spotify and apple music have hurt or helped the appreciation of artists and their songs?</em></span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>I think it definitely is a good way to find new music. I think the mood I subjective, so what persons view of what constitutes as rainy or winter mood is going to be different than anyone else&rsquo;s. especially when I listen to one, I skip quite a bit because I don't think something fits.</strong></span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Yeah, because I think some people, or I know some people may think that having those playlists, and get into the playlist, when they listen to a brand new song that they really like, and then kind of disregard what that song means, or who the artists is for the song, and throw that song into a playlists and not associate the song to an artist</em></span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Yeah I think that's possible, that goes back into passive or active listening. Because if you're active listening you&rsquo;ll seek out what goes into the song, not for the sake of listening to a certain kind of song.</strong></span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Would you say that you are more or less interested in music in general after the coming of Spotify and Apple Music? </em></span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>More, because you have more access to music, more resources to find new music. I pay for spotify premium so that's something too.</strong></span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Do you think you value the times when you were just into soundcloud, opposed to now?</em></span></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Uhhh, I think the soundcloud times were good before ads, and when you could listen without internet. I think after those things changed, I switched to spotify, and moved everything over.</strong></span></p>
