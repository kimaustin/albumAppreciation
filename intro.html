      <p><strong>Album Appreciation.</strong></p>
      <p>This intervention focuses on how the physicallity of things, specifically music, alters the way people percieve and interact with them. I find being physically present with what I am interacting with leads me to more engagement with the interaction.</p>
      <p>With this piece I hope to explore how the digital age has distorted society's view on Albums as a whole.</p>

      <p><strong>The Issues:</strong></p>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
        <li>The reason why we listen to music has been blurred. Music was created as a means for artists to express emotions using creativity. </li>
        <li>Nowadays, people are participating mainly in passive listening, not active listening.</li>
        <li>Digital music brought about the ability to explore and quickly skip through new music at exponentialy faster speeds. This ability, in a system, makes instantly skipping through songs we may not like at first, the norm.</li>
        <li>Albums are the epitome of music creation, but aren't valued anymore</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“I understand the realities we are currently experiencing in the music industry — how customer valuation of music has been on a steady decline since the early 2000s introduced us to mp3s and Napster, how sheer volume of choice has driven listeners to playlists and other passive-listening mechanisms, and how the expectation of instant gratification has shifted people’s expectations and consumption habits.”</p>
